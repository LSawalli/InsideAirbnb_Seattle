## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using the latest Python version.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Inside Airbnb data Version to better understand:

1. Which factors influence the price of a listing?
2. How do prices and availability evolve throughout the year?
3. How do prices vary across different neighborhoods?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to explain the different steps. 
There is an additional "ipynb" file that runs the code.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

My main findings can be found at the post available [here](XXX).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I have to give credit to Inside Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here]([https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?resource=download)).
